                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                <P>The giraffe is nature’s towering marvel—the tallest land animal on Earth, reaching heights of up to 5.5 meters (18 feet) for males.
                    With its long, slender neck and legs, the giraffe is perfectly adapted to browsing treetop foliage that few other herbivores can reach. 
                    Despite its height, it has only seven neck vertebrae—the same number as humans—but each one is greatly elongated.
                    Its coat is a patchwork of irregular brown spots on a creamy background, acting as camouflage in the dappled light of savannah woodlands. 
                    Giraffes use their half-meter-long prehensile tongues to strip leaves from thorny acacia trees with ease. 
                    Social by nature, they often form loose herds and communicate through subtle body language and low-frequency sounds that can travel long distances. 
                    Their gait is unique—moving both legs on one side at once in a graceful pace, and galloping with a rocking motion when needed. 
                    Giraffes are gentle giants, but males engage in dramatic “necking” battles to establish dominance. 
                    With their serene presence and skyward gaze, giraffes embody both elegance and quiet strength in the wild.
