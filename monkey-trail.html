                <h3>MONKEY TRAIL</h3>
                <p> Monkey Trail is a short, scenic jungle path tucked along the cliffs of Ao Nang Beach in Krabi, Thailand. Winding through lush tropical forest, this wooden walkway connects Ao Nang to the quieter Pai Plong Beach. Along the way, hikers often encounter playful long-tailed macaques swinging through the trees or lounging on the railings.
The trail is less than a kilometer long and takes about 15–20 minutes to walk, depending on your pace and how often you stop to admire the sea views or snap photos of the monkeys. Though it’s a relatively easy hike, parts of it can be steep or slippery, especially after rain.
