                <h3>INSECT-HOUSE</h3>
                <p>An insect house—also called a bug hotel—is a small, handmade shelter designed to attract and protect beneficial insects like solitary bees, ladybirds, butterflies, and beetles. Built from natural materials such as bamboo, pinecones, straw, and drilled wood, each section caters to different species. These houses help insects find safe places to nest, hibernate, or lay eggs—especially in gardens or urban areas where natural habitats are limited. Despite their size, insect houses play a big role in supporting biodiversity and healthy ecosystems.</p>
