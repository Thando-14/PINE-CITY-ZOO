                <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                <P>The warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) is a rugged, charismatic wild pig native to sub-Saharan Africa, instantly recognizable by its tusks, facial “warts,” and punk-like mane. Despite its rough appearance, the warthog is a clever and adaptable survivor of the savannah. Its tusks—elongated upper and lower canine teeth—curve outward and upward, used not only for defense but also for digging and sparring during mating season.

Warthogs have dark, bristly skin, a large head, and a compact, muscular body. The “warts” on their faces are actually thick pads of skin that protect them during fights. They often kneel on their calloused front knees to graze, and when threatened, they dash into burrows—usually those abandoned by aardvarks—backward, so their tusks face outward for protection.

Though they may look fierce, warthogs are mostly herbivores, feeding on grasses, roots, and tubers, but they’ll also snack on insects or carrion when needed. They’re social animals, with females and young forming groups called sounders, while males tend to be more solitary.

Warthogs are a perfect blend of grit, humor, and resilience—a reminder that strength doesn’t always come in sleek packages.
