                <h3>LIONS</h3>
                <P>The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the most iconic and majestic animals in the world, often referred to as the “king of beasts.” Native to sub-Saharan Africa and a small region in India, lions are the only truly social big cats, living in structured groups called prides. A pride typically consists of related females, their cubs, and a few dominant males. Male lions are easily recognized by their impressive manes, which vary in color and size and serve to intimidate rivals and attract mates.

Lions are apex predators, hunting primarily at night and preying on large herbivores like zebras, wildebeests, and buffalo. While females do most of the hunting, males defend the pride’s territory, which can span hundreds of square kilometers. Their powerful roars—audible up to 8 kilometers away—serve as both a warning and a declaration of presence.

Physically, lions have muscular, broad-chested bodies, short rounded heads, and a tufted tail. Their coats range from light buff to deep golden brown, blending perfectly with the savannah grasses. Despite their fearsome reputation, lions spend much of their time resting—up to 20 hours a day—conserving energy for bursts of explosive action.

Sadly, lions are classified as *Vulnerable* due to habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure that future generations can continue to witness the raw power and regal beauty of this extraordinary predator.
