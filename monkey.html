                <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                <P>Monkeys are highly intelligent, agile primates known for their playful behavior, expressive faces, and remarkable adaptability. Found across Africa, Asia, Central and South America, they range from the tiny pygmy marmoset—just 12 cm tall—to the robust mandrill with its vivid facial colors and powerful build. Monkeys are typically divided into two groups: Old World monkeys, which live in Africa and Asia and often have narrow noses and non-prehensile tails, and New World monkeys, native to the Americas, with flatter noses and grasping tails ideal for tree-dwelling. Most monkeys are social animals, living in troops where grooming, vocalizations, and body language play key roles in communication and bonding. Their diet is omnivorous, including fruits, leaves, insects, and sometimes small animals. With dexterous hands and forward-facing eyes, monkeys are not only skilled climbers but also problem-solvers, tool users, and even cultural learners in some species. They are a vital part of many ecosystems, but sadly, many face threats from habitat loss, hunting, and the illegal pet trade. Monkeys remind us of our own evolutionary roots and the rich diversity of life in the animal kingdom.
