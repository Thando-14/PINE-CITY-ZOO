                <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                <P>The gorilla is the largest of the great apes and one of our closest living relatives, sharing up to 99% of human DNA. 
                    Native to the tropical forests of equatorial Africa, gorillas are powerful yet gentle creatures, known for their deep social bonds and quiet intelligence. 
                    Adult males, called silverbacks, are distinguished by a streak of silver hair down their backs and lead family groups with a mix of strength and wisdom.
                    Gorillas have broad chests, long muscular arms, and expressive faces with small eyes set into hairless skin. 
                    They primarily move by knuckle-walking and build nests on the ground each night for rest. 
                    Despite their imposing size—males can weigh over 200 kg and stand nearly 1.8 meters tall—gorillas are mostly herbivorous, feeding on leaves, stems, fruit, and shoots. 
                    They live in tight-knit troops and communicate through vocalizations, gestures, and even chest-beating displays. 
                    Sadly, all gorilla species are endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and disease, making conservation efforts critical to their survival. 
                    These majestic primates are not just icons of the wild—they are symbols of strength, family, and the fragile beauty of our natural world.
