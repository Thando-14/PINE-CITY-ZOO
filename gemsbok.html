                <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                <P>The gemsbok, also known as the South African oryx (*Oryx gazella*), is a striking antelope built for survival in some of the harshest landscapes on Earth.
                    Native to the arid regions of southern Africa—especially the Kalahari and Namib deserts—it’s instantly recognizable by its long, straight horns (which both males and females possess), 
                    bold black-and-white facial markings, and sandy-gray coat. 
                    Standing up to 1.4 meters tall at the shoulder and weighing as much as 250 kilograms, the gemsbok is both powerful and elegant. 
                    Its horns can reach up to 120 cm in length and are used for defense against predators like lions and hyenas. 
                    Adapted to desert life, gemsbok can survive without drinking water for long periods, drawing moisture from roots and tubers and cooling their brains through a specialized nasal system. 
                    They live in herds and are known for their horse-like gallop and muscular build. With their regal posture and resilience, gemsbok are living emblems of strength, grace, and adaptation in the wild.
