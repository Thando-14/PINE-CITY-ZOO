                <h3>TIGER</h3>
                <P>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest member of the cat family and one of the most powerful predators in the animal kingdom. With its muscular build, deep orange coat, and bold black stripes, the tiger is a symbol of strength, stealth, and raw beauty. Each tiger’s stripe pattern is unique—like a fingerprint—and even extends to its skin. Native to Asia, tigers inhabit a range of environments from the snowy forests of Siberia to the tropical jungles of India and Southeast Asia.

Tigers are solitary hunters, relying on their camouflage and silent movement to ambush prey such as deer, wild boar, and buffalo. They can leap over 9 meters in a single bound and have powerful jaws capable of crushing bone. Despite their fearsome reputation, tigers are also nurturing parents—females raise their cubs alone, teaching them to hunt and survive in the wild.

There are several subspecies, including the Bengal, Siberian, Sumatran, and Malayan tigers, though all are endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and human conflict. As apex predators, tigers play a vital role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems. Their presence is not just a sign of wilderness—it’s a call to protect what remains of the wild.
