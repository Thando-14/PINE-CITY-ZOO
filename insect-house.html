                <h3>RHINO-BEETLE</h3>
                <P>The Rhino Beetle – Nature’s Armored Powerlifter. 
The rhinoceros beetle is one of the strongest creatures on Earth relative to its size—capable of lifting objects up to 850 times its own weight. Named for the horn-like projections on the males’ heads, these beetles look like miniature tanks with a flair for the dramatic. Their horns aren’t for defense against predators, but for battling rival males during mating season—think of it as insect jousting.

Found on every continent except Antarctica, rhino beetles thrive in forests, gardens, and under leaf litter, where they feed on fruit, nectar, and sap as adults, while their larvae munch on decaying wood. Despite their fearsome appearance, they’re completely harmless to humans—no biting, no stinging, just a lot of quiet strength.

They’re also nocturnal and often hide during the day, emerging at night to explore. When threatened, they can produce a hissing squeak by rubbing their abdomen against their wing covers—a bluff more than a battle cry.
