                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                <P>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is a tree-dwelling marsupial native to eastern and southern Australia, instantly recognizable by its round, fluffy ears, large black nose, and dense grey fur. Despite often being called a “koala bear,” it’s not a bear at all—its closest relative is the wombat. Koalas are highly specialized herbivores, feeding almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves, which are low in nutrients and laced with toxins. To survive this diet, koalas have a long digestive tract and a unique gut microbiome that helps break down the tough, toxic foliage. They sleep up to 20 hours a day to conserve energy, nestled in the forks of eucalyptus trees where they also find food and shelter. Koalas are solitary and territorial, with males using deep bellows and scent glands on their chests to mark their presence. Females raise their young—called joeys—in a backward-facing pouch until they’re old enough to cling to their mother’s back. Though iconic and beloved, koalas are considered a vulnerable species due to habitat destruction, disease, and climate change. They are living symbols of Australia’s unique biodiversity and the delicate balance of forest ecosystems.
